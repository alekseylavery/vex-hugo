Are you all cooped up with COVID? How about starting your own coop of famous chickens?

Our family brought home a small group of chicks from our sons kindergarten class last year. We began a coop of our own backyard chickens! We soon began to develop a family card game to comm emorate our favorite girls.

**Flock of Fame** was born. Create a coop of you own and lay valuable eggs! Pair Roosters and Hens for extra points. Face eggstraneous circumstances, like climate change, predators and more...

It is a flocking good time!!

A percentage of the proceeds will go to providing chickens to families in need![](/images/lxelabs-small.png)
