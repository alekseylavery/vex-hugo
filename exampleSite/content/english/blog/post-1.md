Different predators allow you to change the course of the game. Rats eat an egg from your opponentâ€™s coop. Raccoons eat a hen, and foxes will force your opponent to discard a rooster. Roosters protect from the rats and raccoons, and if you have the super coop upgrade NO predators can get your chickens.
