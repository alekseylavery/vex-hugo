Once you have a hen in your hand you will want to get them down. Place hens in your ‘coop’ and start to lay eggs! Each hen can lay one egg per turn, with the exception of an upgrade card (sir squirms alot) that allows you to lay two. Collect three of a kind hens to build a clique for extra points. Beware of the climate change card that stops hens from laying eggs for one round, or the dreaded outbreak card that culls your entire flock.
